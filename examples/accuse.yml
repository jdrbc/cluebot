setup:
  # players starting with dealer
  # solution is: green, kitchen, dagger
  players:
    - name: bob
      # bob has cards: "plum", "hall"
      card_count: 2
    - name: joe
      # joe has card: "scarlet"
      card_count: 1
    - name: meg
      cards: "white"

  cards:
    suspects: ["white", "plum", "scarlet", "green"]
    rooms: ["kitchen", "hall"]
    weapons: ["dagger"]

events:
  - r: "nobody kitchen" # should set kitchen as answer
  - accuse: "bob scarlet kitchen dagger" # bob's guess
  - accuse: "joe plum kitchen dagger" # joe's guess
  # should infer green, even though we don't know for sure what bob & joe's cards are
  # (if they aren't dumb we could infer thier cards, but they could have guessed their own)
